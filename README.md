JUST A SLOT MACHINE...

Load the flow into node-red... copy paste and import it.

Go to your node-red server with the endpoint:   /sidslot

This will load the slot machine into the browser.
I was gearing this to adapt to multiple lines, with the ability to adjust the matrix of the slot items.
Have not yet made any Line Counting and payout or otherwise.... Maybe contributions can accomodate if they feel challenged.
